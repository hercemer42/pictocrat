A cross-platform picture viewer/manager.

Warning: Work in progress!

It should work on Windows, Mac and Linux.

The ultimate aim is for it to act like a screensaver that shows a slideshow, which one can pause to maniupulate the images.
One can pause, go back, go forward, delete or hide an image or folder, tag an image in a category etc..
The percieved need is for people who don't have the time to triage their photos in one sitting.
With this application, they can do it bit by bit.
A suggested application is to run it on a Raspberry Pi connected to a screen in a busy area like the kitchen or lounge.

This application was bootstrapped with the angular-electron package by Maxime Gris
